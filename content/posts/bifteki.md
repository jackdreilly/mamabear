# Ingredients

- 4-5 tablespoon(s) olive oil
- 1 onion
- 1 clove(s) of garlic
- 1 sprig(s) thyme
- 150 g sandwich bread
- 1 teaspoon(s) oregano, dry
- 1 teaspoon(s) paprika, smoked
- 50 ml milk
- 500 g ground pork
- 500 g ground beef
- lemon zest, of 1 lemon
- 1 egg
- 1 bunch parsley
- 1 bunch mint
- salt
- pepper

# Instructions

Preheat the oven to 180* C (350* F) set to fan.

Place a pan over high heat and add 1 tablespoon of olive oil.

Add the chopped onions and sauté until nicely caramelized.

Add the sliced garlic, thyme and sauté.

When ready, transfer to a food processor.

Add the 3-4 tablespoons of olive oil, sliced bread and beat until the bread breaks down.

Add the oregano, paprika, and milk.

Process until the mixture is completely combined.

Transfer to a large bowl.

Add the ground beef and ground pork, lemon zest, egg, finely chopped parsley and
the mint and a generous amount of salt and pepper.

Mix by sort of mashing the mixture between your fingers, until all of the ingredients are completely combined. You will see the mixture coming together nicely. Pick up some of the meatball mixture and shape it into 6-8 large patties. They should be between 220 g and 250 g each.

You can make them any size you like, but if you make them smaller, cook them less so they don’t dry out.

Place them on a rimmed baking sheet that is lined with parchment paper.

Drizzle them with some Greek extra virgin olive oil.

Roast for 30-40 minutes.
