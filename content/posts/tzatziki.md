# Ingredients

- 1 large cucumber
- Greek yogurt
- Garlic
- Dill
- Olive oil
- salt
- Grate 1 big cucumber with the cheese grater

# Instructions

Working with one big handful at a time, lightly squeeze the grated cucumber
between your palms over the sink to remove excess moisture. You can use a paper
towel as well to remove excess water.

Transfer the squeezed cucumber to a serving bowl, and repeat with the remaining cucumber.

Add the yogurt, olive oil, dill, garlic, and salt to the bowl, and stir to blend. Let the mixture rest for 5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
